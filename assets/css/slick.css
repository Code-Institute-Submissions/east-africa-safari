<h4>Maasai Mara National Reserve</h4>
<p class="inline-block">
It is one of the key popular tourism points in Kenya, located in South-Western Kenya along the Great-Rift Valley adjacent 
to Serengeti National Park of Tanzania. The attractions in Maasai Mara National Reserve are both Nature and Wildlife. 
The Wildebeest migration is also witnessed in the Kenya iconic Maasai Mara National Reserve. A good short safari combination 
for those hoping to also see all these charismatic creatures (The Big Five)(and much more besides) would be Maasai Mara (for
lion, leopard, bufallo, and elephant) and Lake Nakuru (for black and white rhino).

<h4>Wilderbeast Migration</h4>
<p class="inline-block"> 
 The best time to witness the migration from the Serengeti to Maasai Mara is between July and September. 
 During this period the greatest spectacle on earth unfolds right before your eyes. Over a million wildebeest, 
 zebra and gazelles make their way to Maasai Mara by crossing the crocodile-infested Mara River in search for 
 greener pastures. Unfortunately though many are attacked and killed in the process.  
</p>
<p class="inline-block"> 
 The exact timing may change from year to year as it is a spontaneous event influenced by rainfall patterns and the 
 subsequent grazing opportunities. The animals are constantly on the move all year-round. They stay in the Maasai Mara 
 from July to october before gradually migrating back to the Serengeti from November.

<h4>Bwindi Imprenatrable National Park</h4>
<p class="inline-block"> 
 Among East African forests, Bwindi has some of the richest populations of trees, small mammals, birds, reptiles, 
 butterflies and moths. The park's diverse species are partly a result of the large variations of elevation and 
 habitatatypes in the park and may also be because the forest was a refuge for species during glaciation in the 
 Pleistocene epoch.
</p>
<p class="inline-block"> 
 The park is inhabited by about 600 individual mountain gorillas known as the Bwindi population, which makes up 
 almost half of all the mountain gorillas in the world.

 small family groups.Typically, the chimps are located by listening for their pant-hooting calls, then hustle to the area from 
 which they are calling. They are observed as they feed in fruiting trees, lounge and socialize with each other or even occasionaly hunt.

 predators (lion, leopard, spotted hyena, etc), antelopes, buffaloes, hippos, elephants. more than 610 bird species (probably the
