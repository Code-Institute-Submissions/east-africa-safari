        desc: `Maasai Mara National Reserve is one of the key popular tourism points in Kenya. It is located in 
        South-Western Kenya along the Great Rift Valley adjacent to Serengeti National Park of Tanzania. The 
        attraction in Maasai Mara National Reserve are both nature and wildlife. The Wildebeest migration is 
        also witnessed in the Kenya iconic Masai Mara National Reserve. A good short safari combination for those hoping
        to also see all these charismatic creatures (THE BIG FIVE)(and much more besides would be Masai Mara (for lion,
        leopard,buffalo and elephant) and lake Nakuru (for black and white rhino)`,
