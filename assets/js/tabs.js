        the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The highest peak of the Ruwenzori reaches 5,109 metres (16,762 ft), and the range's
        upper regions are permanently snow-capped and glaciated. Rivers fed by mountain streams form one of the sources of the 
        Nile,[1] for which reason during the European exploration of Africa, the Ruwenzori came to be identified with the 
        legendary Mountains of the Moon, identified by the Greek scholar Ptolemy as the source of the Nile.
        The Ruwenzori are known for their vegetation, ranging from tropical rainforest through alpine meadows to snow. The range 
        supports its own species and varieties of giant groundsel and giant lobelia and even has a 6 metres (20 ft) tall heather
        covered in moss that lives on one of its peaks. Most of the range is now a World Heritage Site and is covered jointly by
        Rwenzori Mountains National Park in southwestern Uganda and the Virunga National Park in the eastern Congo.`,

        Tarangire River that crosses the park. The Tarangire River is the primary source of fresh water for wild animals in the
        Tarangire Ecosystem during the annual dry season. The Tarangire Ecosystem is defined by the long-distance migration of
        wildebeest and zebras. During the dry season thousands of animals concentrate in Tarangire National Park from the 
        surrounding wet-season dispersal and calving areas. The oldest known elephant to give birth to twins is found in 
        Tarangrire. A recent birth of elephant twins in the Tarangire National Park of Tanzania is a great example of how 
        the birth of these two healthy and thriving twins can beat the odds.
        Home to more than 550 bird species, the park is a haven for bird enthusiasts.`,
