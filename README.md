# East Africa Safari

East Africa Safari is an imagined travel site that I created to inspire and motivate users from accross the globe to tour 
East Africa having featured top travel destinations in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania at the moment.

Having completed Javascript Fundamentals and Interactive Front-end Development, Full Stack Web Development Program 
with Code Institute I developed East Africa Safari website for my Milestone 2 Project, whereby I was to implement 
and showcase acquired skills, building interactive and responsive website with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript as required.

I have used 2 javaScript APIs in my project, googlemaps API to help users that are looking for travel destinations to 
locate some in  East Africa. 

As a developer EmailJs will enable me get neccessary feedback and implement where possible, thereby improving the efficiency
of the website.

As a user seeking to pass information to the developer, EmailJs will facilitate delivery of feedback to the developer and 
also response to the user.

## UX Design Processes

### Strategy Plane
*Having identified the needs of different users, I needed to develope a site that will give value to both the developer 
and the user. Appropriate use of HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript would help me achieve an interactive site.

### Scope Plane
* This is where according to user needs I incorporated a map, top travel destinations and feedback section for my users 
be totally informed and interact with the site, and top destinations section too as a feature would help th user explore top
travel destinations through the read more buttons also.

### structure Plane
* At this stage i organised my data seeing to it that site information is presented well.
* I started with the navigation bar at the top and footer at the bottom.
* The navigation bar has links to allow navigation to different areas.
* The navbar and the footer has same background colors for easy identification.
* A corousel section to engage the user.
* A destinations section to invite the user to top destinations section.
* Previews stories section to inspire the user.
* Map section to help user see locations in the map.
* Feedback section for any feedback from the user.
* With different color variations to keep the user engaged.

### Skeleton Plane
* At this stage I was sketching my design to see how I will practically organise my data.
* Creating design for each section to see how images, text and additional features will fit in their apparent sections.
* This required drawing designs for different sections and different bscreen sizes.

### Surface Plane
* At the surface plane I needed to come up with an visuallyu appealing site, google fonts I picked three different fonts
  and incorpared different colors for contrast. The sequence in which information was presented is consistent too.
* I incorporated images in top destinations section and preview section too and also in the feedback form, just  to make 
the site appealing in order to achieve the sites developer an user objectives
* Buttons with hove state to capture the attention of the user
* Contrast in colors for buttons and text.
