# East Africa Safari

East Africa Safari is an imagined travel site that I created to inspire and motivate users from accross the globe to tour 
East Africa having featured top travel destinations in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania at the moment.

Having completed Javascript Fundamentals and Interactive Front-end Development, Full Stack Web Development Program 
with Code Institute I developed East Africa Safari website for my Milestone 2 Project, whereby I was to implement 
and showcase acquired skills, building interactive and responsive website with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript as required.

I have used 2 javaScript APIs in my project, googlemaps API to help users that are looking for travel destinations to 
locate some in  East Africa. 

As a developer EmailJs will enable me get neccessary feedback and implement where possible, thereby improving the efficiency
of the website.

As a user seeking to pass information to the developer, EmailJs will facilitate delivery of feedback to the developer and 
also response to the user.


# ux

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the backend lessons.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here are the updates since the original video was made:

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!
